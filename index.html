<p><em>"An outstanding fusion of oral history, journalism and political activism. Tom Doig has worked hard and well to collect impressive first person accounts of the [2014] Morwell fire and of the time before and after; he has written a compelling account that threads those accounts into his narrative almost seamlessly, so that although the book and the framing is his, the evidence and the power comes from the testimony. This is, by any measure, an impressive and innovative example of contemporary activist oral history."</em>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>&lsquo;The smoke got thicker and darker and then it seemed to be coming from everywhere, swirling around until it blanketed the entire town . . .&rsquo;</em></strong></p>
<p>On 9 February 2014 a fire took hold in Victoria&rsquo;s Hazelwood coal mine next to Morwell and burned for one and a half months. As the air filled with toxic smoke and ash, residents of the Latrobe Valley became ill, afraid &ndash; and angry. Up against an unresponsive corporation and an indifferent government, the community banded together, turning tragedy into a political fight.</p>
<p>Tom Doig reveals the decades of decisions that led to the fire, and gives an intimate account of the first moments of the blaze and the dark weeks that followed.<em>The Coal Face</em>&nbsp;is a gripping and immediate report of one of the worst environmental and public health disasters in Australian history.&nbsp;</p>

                "Climate change has moved from being predomin- antly a physical phenomenon to being simultan- eously a social phenomenon."
                <br><span>&ndash; <a href='http://www.mikehulme.org/'>Mike Hulme, Professor of Climate and Culture, Kingâ€™s College London</a></span>            </aside>
            
         
            
            
            <p><strong>"The climate is changing, it's definitely changing. But it's <em>not</em>&nbsp;because of climate change!"</strong><br /><em>- drunk man in bar, Napier, NZ (2012)<br /></em><br /><strong>&ldquo;global warming/climate change is a headf@#k&rdquo;<br /></strong><em>- @alexmatter, Twitter (2011) &nbsp;</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am currently a <a href="http://artsonline.monash.edu.au/journalism/phd/" target="_blank">Journalism PhD candidate at Monash University</a>, researching a book about the lived experience of climate change in Australia, provisionally called <strong><em>Hot Cold Hot: T<strong>he Lived Experience of Climate Change in Australia</strong></em></strong>. This book&nbsp;will combine oral history and literary journalism methodologies (basically, I'm going to do a lot of really long interviews with a range of people). The book will be researched in 2014-2015 and published in 2016,&nbsp;and is intended for a general audience.</p>
<p><strong>PROJECT SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>There is overwhelming scientific consensus on the issue of anthropogenic (human-caused) climate change. However,<strong> climate change is not just a scientific phenomenon; it is also a&nbsp;<em>cultural phenomenon</em></strong>. As such, climate change affects almost every aspect of our lives, from our religious/philosophical ideas about what it means to be human, through to the countless (un)ethical consumer choices we are faced with every day. In this broader context, <strong>there is unavoidable disagreement and conflict about what climate change ultimately &lsquo;means&rsquo;&mdash;and, more importantly, what we should be doing about it.</strong></p>
<p>Journalism is an essential part of the 'cultural circuit' (Hulme, 2009) that determines how people understand and experience climate change. However, <strong>the institutions of Australian journalism are particularly ill-equipped to represent the significance of climate change to the public.</strong> The Murdoch press&rsquo; purposeful distortion and confusion of climate science for political-ideological reasons is only the most blatant example of this. However, <em>all</em> newsroom journalism, with its focus on the here-and-now and its preference for stories of conflict and celebrity, struggles to engage with the climate change &lsquo;story&rsquo;&mdash;which is mind-bogglingly complex, incremental, lacking in traditional &lsquo;conflict&rsquo;, and of extremely long duration, with implications for centuries to come. <strong>At its heart, this journalistic failure is a failure of<em>contextualisation</em>.</strong></p>
<p>To make the journalistic concept of &lsquo;public interest&rsquo; properly meaningful to our discussions of climate change, <strong>journalism needs to provide the public with nuanced and diverse accounts of how people currently acutally experience and make sense of climate change.</strong> The practices of long-form cultural journalism and oral history prioritise the everyday experiences of ordinary people, and focus on the 'Big Picture'. This sense of context &nbsp;(cultural, social, historical)&nbsp;is needed for an in-depth investigation of people&rsquo;s lived experiences of climate change.</p>
<p><strong>INTERVIEW LOCATIONS</strong></p>
<p>I will be talking to a range of people in the following climate change 'hotspots' around Australia:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>the <strong>Cairns</strong> region, far north Queensland (near the endangdered Great Barrier Reef)</li>
<li>the <strong>Darwin</strong> region, Northern Territory (suffering from increased sea levels and biodiversity loss)</li>
<li>the <strong>Perth&nbsp;</strong>region, southwest Western Australia (exposed to reduced rainfall)</li>
<li><strong>Inner Melbourne</strong>, Victoria (a 'cultural hotspot' containing the highest concentration of Greens voters in Australia)</li>
<li><strong>Kinglake &amp; Marysville</strong>, Victoria (sites of the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires, Australia&rsquo;s worst natural disaster)</li>
<li>the <strong>Mullumbimby</strong> region, northern New South Wales (a cultural hotspot for 'self-funded retirees, hippies and burnt-out tree-changers' aspiring to low-carbon lifestyles)</li>
<li>the <strong>Morwell</strong> region, Victoria (site of the Hazelwood Coal Mine Fire, 'one of the largest, longest running and most complex fires in the State&rsquo;s history').</li>
</ul>
<p><em><a href="http://www.moron2moron.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Tom-Doig-Confirmation-Appendix-Australias-climate-change-hotspots.jpg" target="_blank">Map of Australian climate change hotspots</a></em></p>
<p><strong>TYPES OF LIVED EXPERIENCE</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Hot Cold Hot: T<strong>he Lived Experience of Climate Change in Australia</strong></em></strong>&nbsp;will investigate the relationships between individuals&rsquo; <strong>views</strong>, their <strong>values</strong>, and their&nbsp;<strong>lived experiences&nbsp;</strong>of climate change. This will include a spectrum of personal experience, including but not limited to:</p>
<ol>
<li>the direct experience of an<strong> extreme weather event</strong>, such as bushfire</li>
<li>the indirect experience of an extreme weather event <strong>via the media and/or interactions with other people</strong></li>
<li>the experience of a <strong>chronic, long-term weather event</strong>, such as drought</li>
<li>the experience of <strong>the science, politics and/or ethics of climate change</strong> via the media&nbsp;and/or interactions with other people</li>
<li>the experience of <strong>making personal lifestyle and/or occupational changes</strong> due to one&rsquo;s perceptions of climate change</li>
<li>the experience of <strong>being confused, unsure and/or ambivalent</strong> about the reality and/or significance of climate change</li>
<li>the experience of <strong>having no experience of climate change whatsoever</strong>.<br />&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>I am interested in the subjective, the emotional, the&nbsp;bewildering, the inconsistent, the paradoxical, the hypocritical, the upsetting and even the blackly humorous aspects of First World life under climate change.&nbsp;Faced simultaneously with &ldquo;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqZvpRjGtGM" target="_blank">the great moral challenge of our generation</a>&rdquo; (Rudd, 2007) and &ldquo;<a href="http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/27/global-warming-and-the-tyranny-of-boredom/?_r=0" target="_blank">quite possibly THE most boring subject the science world has ever had to present to the public&rdquo; </a>(Olson, in Revkin, 2010), <strong><em>Hot Cold Hot:&nbsp;<strong><em>T<strong>he Lived Experience of Climate Change in Australia</strong></em></strong></em></strong>&nbsp;will respond to such ontological incongruity not (only) with self-righteousness, but (also) with gallows humour.&nbsp;</p>

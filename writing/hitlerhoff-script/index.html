<p>HITLERHOFF <em>[to </em>SCREEN HITLERHOFF<em>]</em>:Hitlerhoff, how did you become so great?</p>
<p>SCREEN HITLERHOFF: Well, Hitlerhoff <em>[laughs]</em>, funny you should ask. It all began one morning in June some twenty years ago, when I was born a rich man&rsquo;s son. I had everything that money could buy &ndash; but freedom, I had none &hellip;</p>
<p><em>[</em>SCREEN HITLERHOFF<em>&rsquo;s mouth opens wide; </em>HITLERHOFF <em>is sucked back into it. Black-out.]</em>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>[Table with tablecloth, oversized can of sauerkraut.</em> HITLERHOFF JUNIOR <em>enters, singing, and stands on a chair; </em>MUMMY <em>stands devotedly at his feet.]</em></p>

<p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</em>HITLERHOFF <em>[to audience]</em>: &hellip; but he had no talent. None. So instead, he became a <em>[coughs] </em>monster postal worker. Daddy wanted me to follow in his footsteps.</p>
<p><em>[pause.]</em></p>
<p>I did not want to follow in his footsteps.</p>
<p>SCENE TWO&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>[Dinnertime. </em>HITLERHOFF JUNIOR<em> joins </em>MUMMY <em>and </em>DADDY<em> at the table. The atmosphere is tense.]</em></p>

<p>MUMMY: There&rsquo;s something special about you, Hoffy, you can feel it in my bosom. You have a &hellip; gift. Use it.</p>
<p>HITLERHOFF JUNIOR: Mummy, I had a &hellip; dream last night.</p>
<p>MOTHER: Was it about &ndash; your destiny?</p>
<p>HITLERHOFF JUNIOR <em>[stands up, walks downstage]</em>: I was in our living space, and it was so big &hellip; it stretched on forever, like an endless beach covered in skulls &hellip; I was running in slow-motion, looking for freedom.</p>
<p>MUMMY: How visionary!</p>
<p>HITLERHOFF JUNIOR: In the distance, I saw a man &hellip; a hero superman, with muscles like coconuts and hair like a tsunami &hellip;</p>
<p>MUMMY: Oh, Hoffy &hellip;</p>
<p>HITLERHOFF JUNIOR: I ran towards him, and he told me &hellip;</p>
<p>MUMMY: Yes?</p>
<p><em>[</em>DADDY <em>re-enters room.]</em></p>

<p><em>Video Title: &ldquo;Hitlerhoff is the Night Doctor&rdquo; </em></p>
<p><em>Onscreen: a video sequence</em>. SCREEN HITLERHOFF <em>is incredibly famous, rich and successful, surrounded by Aryan celebrities.&nbsp;</em><em>The screen opens up like a garage door; the KITT car from </em>Knight Rider <em>drives slowly onstage, with </em>HITLERHOFF <em>on the bonnet, playing a black electric guitar shaped like a swastika.</em></p>
<p>HITLERHOFF: Lights, camera, Auschwitz! <em>[Laughs for a very long time.] </em></p>
<p><em>Glitter, dollar bills, fan-mail, golden Stars of David, and black swastikas fall from the sky in slow-motion.</em></p>
<p>HITLERHOFF <em>[to himself]</em>: Envelopes, envelopes, envelopes &hellip; all for the Night Doctor! <em>[He catches an envelope in mid-air, opens it and reads aloud.] </em>&ldquo;Dear Night Doctor, thank you for autographing my daughter after your rousing speech! Your manly fingers have cured her thesbianism, and she&rsquo;s just dying for you to call, like you promised &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beloved Night Doctor, I just lovedyour world tour of <em>Waiting for Godotte II: Return of the Godotte! </em>I can&rsquo;t wait for <em>Waiting for Godotte III: the Godotte Strikes Back!</em>&rdquo; Neither can the Night Doctor, Timmy.</p>
<p><em>[Lights up: a press conference. </em>HOBIE <em>and </em>CJ <em>have &ldquo;Hitlerhoff&rdquo; armbands.]</em></p>
<p>HOBIE: Master Night Doctor Sir! Your incredible healing powers &ndash; what is your secret?</p>
<p>HITLERHOFF: Let&rsquo;s just say I believe in the power of dreams. <em>[applause.]</em></p>
<p>CJ: Your Honourable Greatness! What do you think is causing this foul sickness?</p>
<p>HITLERHOFF: Communism. <em>[pause.] </em>Thesbianism. <em>[pause.] </em>The Red Tide! <em>[Boo]</em></p>
<p><em>[</em>HOBIE <em>and </em>CJ <em>scream. They hold pre-scripted cue cards up to front-row audience members&rsquo; faces, forcing them to ask questions to </em>HITLERHOFF<em>.</em> HITLERHOFF <em>drinks from a hipflask.]</em></p>
<p>AUDIENCE MEMBER ONE: Our superior worshipful father-figure, please tell us about your new show.</p>
<p>HITLERHOFF: It is set in a paradise on earth. Everyone is tanned, hairless, blonde-eyed and blue-blood blazing. <em>[applause] </em>It is always summer, every day is a holiday, and everyone always goes to beach, mate. <em>[applause] </em>Fertile women and super men perform heroic deeds in a eugenic montage of perfect teeth, tits, rollerblades, dildoes, hot pink cunt and frozen yoghurt. <em>[Canned applause] </em>My show will catch on like the plague across Austria-lia, -lia, -lia, lia, lia, making me the most-watched man in the history of civilisation. People will still be talking about me one thousand years time! <em>[salutes. Canned</em> <em>applause.]</em></p>
<p>AUDIENCE MEMBER TWO: Oh beloved charismatic overlord, what is the moral of your show?</p>
<p>HITLERHOFF: There is no evil on this planet that cannot be conquered by the right mix of plastic surgery and special treatment. <em>[applause.]</em></p>
<p>AUDIENCE MEMBER THREE: Mr Beefcake, are you drunk?</p>
<p>HITLERHOFF: What?!</p>
<p>AUDIENCE MEMBER THREE: Is it true what Pamela Andovich says, that you only have one testicle?</p>
<p><em>[</em>HITLERHOFF <em>prepares to stab</em> AUDIENCE MEMBER THREE<em>. Blackout.]</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</em>HITLERHOFF <em>[to audience]</em>: The gutter press! <em>[Deep calming breath.] </em>The Night Doctor exterminates all the negative influences in his life, he concentrates on making a difference.

All over the world &ndash; hospitals, talk shows, saving lives, granting <em>[coughs] </em>MERCY DEATHS &ndash; it is the greatest <em>[Drinks from a hipflask; his monologue continues &ndash; it is pre-recorded. </em>HITLERHOFF <em>keeps his mouth shut.

A terrible plague sweeps the land. The Red Tide is spreading, rising, like a huge &hellip; body of water.</p>
<p>No one is safe! No one knows what &ndash; or <em>who</em> &ndash; is responsible &hellip; The Night Doctor switches from auto-cruise mode into pursuit mode. He needs to touch more women and children. He needs to touch the whole world!</p>

<p>RECORDING: The Night Doctor has something to prove. He will show the world he is more than a guy who runs in slow-motion, more than a guy with one testicle.

<p><em>[Spotlight slowly up on </em>HITLERHOFF. <em>There is a chain-link fence, topped with barbed wire, between the audience and the stage. </em>HITLERHOFF <em>pauses for a long time.

<p>HITLERHOFF: Ladies. Gentlemen. Lovers of degenerate art. Welcome to Hitlerhoff &ndash; the show to end all shows. It&rsquo;s great to be here in Austria-lia. This is a real triumph for me &ndash; a triumph of the will, you might say. The doors are still locked? Wunderbar.</p>
<p>People, we stand on the edge of an abyss! The tide, the Red Tide &hellip; Some say, &ldquo;life is a beach&rdquo;. I say: life is a battlefield. A battlefield, and we must all take sides &ndash; now!&nbsp;This is our choice, people, our free choice. Because we <em>are</em> free, whether we value our freedom or not. And we <em>are</em> special, whether we deserve to be &ndash; or not.&nbsp;We live a very special life. We enjoy &ndash; everything. We expect &ndash; special treatment.&nbsp;Millions of people are being sacrificed, right now.&nbsp;Whole continents are being sacrificed, right now.&nbsp;The entire planet is being sacrificed, right now, to preserve our very special way of life.&nbsp;This is our holocaust. This is our freedom! Are you making the most of it?</p>
<p><em>[pause.]</em></p>
<p>People! We are running out of options. We are running out of excuses. We are running out of time. If we really want to live in a paradise on earth, we&nbsp;must not turn back. We must not slow down. We must keep making sacrifices. Freedom will set you free. Freedom will set you free!&nbsp;Are you with me,&nbsp;people?&nbsp;Are you with me?!</p>
<p><em>[pause.]</em></p>
<p>People, my patience is at an end.If you are not willing to save the world, the world is not willing to save you. If you are not part of the final solution, you are part of the final solution, you are part of the final problem. You deserve re-education &ndash; and special treatment.&nbsp;<em>[Sound effects from behind the audience&rsquo;s seats: gas.]&nbsp;</em>Special treatment! You all deserve special treatment!!</p>
